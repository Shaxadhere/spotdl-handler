## Disclaimer

This tool is merely a bridge between existing software. The software by itself does not allow users to download media or perform any tasks that may be illegal in your country. I am not a lawyer and can not give legal advise on the use of this software or `spotdl` for that matter. This project was a fun little challenge for myself. Please support the artists you listen to by buying their music!
